# **Restaurant Application**


## TASKS
Built a real life website for a restaurant. Mainly 5 tasks are done when you go in a restaurant as follows:

1. You get the menu:- On the load of the screen run this function and fetch to get the food items from the JSON and show them to a user
2. Someone takes your Order:- Now assume that the user is ordering and should take 2500 milliseconds to resolve the order, choose any 3 items randomly.
3. Order is preparing:- Order is given to the chef and chef starts preparing and it takes 1500 milliseconds.
4. Pay:- Eat the items and Pay for it which takes 1000 milliseconds.
5. So inshort you need to handle 4 promises back to back and run the last thankyou fnc one after the other. use either promise chaining or async await
   or promise methods to do the following.
